                I made this project for a local store that needed to manage their products, providers, orders, and
                sales. 🛍️ This project has been made with <strong>React</strong> with <strong>Tailwind</strong> in the
                frontend, <strong>NodeJs</strong> in the backend,
                and the database in <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. 💼
                <br>
                This project is a desktop application made with <strong>ElectronJs</strong> that uses web tools to make
                this possible.

                I use multiple libraries to handle validations, manage the routes, and simplify the database connection,
                including migrations, retrieval, and data insertion. 📚
                <br>
                <br>
                This project has been quite a challenge. I had to learn a lot of new things to make this possible. I had
                to learn how to configure React with an Electron.js app and how to send and retrieve information from
                the backend (which is within the project itself). 👨‍💻
